<p>This is a weather website that was developed as a part of my initial stages of learning frontend and backend development. This takes access to the user's current location and displays the weather at that place. It uses openweather APIs to get the current weather data and display it to the user.This is a demo image of how the website gets displayed on the user's window </p>
